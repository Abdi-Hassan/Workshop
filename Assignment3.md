# A Methodological Investigation of Child and Adolescent Educational Attainment in Somalia

Child and adolescent education attainment is among the most important development goals any country can have. A staple of a developed nation, that may oftentimes be taken for granted, is a functional education machine, one capable of producing literate and numerate adults capable of critical thinking. In many developed countries, these “machines” are provided by the government as one of many critical institutional and infrastructural commitments to its people. Looking at a LMIC such as Somalia, it may come as a surprise that this commitment is not upheld, sarcasm, by the remnants of a government the nation has. We look, then, to the reasons for why this commitment is not made and upheld and further to how it can be to understand the seemingly intractable problem of child and adolescent education attainment in Somalia. If knowledge is power, after all, why would a nation not want to field a powerful capable citizenry?
	There are many obvious and some not so obvious explanations to all of this. For starters, there is a lack of federal stability over the nation state as a whole which makes any form of stable, standardized, education system all but impossible to administer with the feuding tribes, warlords, religious leaders, and government officials in a power struggle. Beyond this, there is a deeply cultural and religious effect on education in the nation with many only attending schooling to further their grasp of Islam and propogate their spirituality. Beyond this, there is the pervasive view on gender roles with women and girls specifically being disadvantaged in the pursuit of education as they are seen as domestic servants first. This is all the more prevalent in the many rural pockets of the nation state in which domestic and agricultural work is of primary importance. This leaves one to ponder, what can be done to increase child and adolescent education attainment in Somalia?
	To answer that question, an explanatory inquiry will be pursued. By seeking to understand what is happening, the current situation, by its causes and effects, it is my hope that the inputs can be changed or enhanced so as to yield a more desirable output. We will view mapped data on Somali school enrollment as well school enrollment disaggregated for gender to help us gauge the situation and gain insights to the demography of schooling.

From this data we glean some new information and some information that is actually quite unexpected. For one, the largest clusters of schools are present where there are major roads and rivers. This makes sense and is to be expected but should not be overlooked when analyzing factors that lead to educational attainment being more accessible. Beyond this, there are actually very odd densities in enrollment throughout the countries. Where one would expect total district enrollment to be greatest-in excess of 10,000 category-like in major cities such as the nations capital, there is actually high but not highest enrollment. Also, when analyzing gender makeup of the schools, the maps tell a scattered story. The majority of the areas have male dominated schools (to be expected), however, there are some female dominated districts. The only issue with this, though, is these female dominated districts seem to have no shared rule of thumb in regards to size, area type, population density, or even location so it is hard to know what accounts for this. Personally, I suspect the impact of IDP to be having a confounding effect on the data.
