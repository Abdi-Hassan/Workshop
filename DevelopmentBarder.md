### What did Barder mean by "resist fatalism"? Who was Norman Borlaug and what is the Green Revolution? Page 47
Resisting fatalism, the idea that all events are predetermined and therefore inevitable, means not accepting a preordained path for 
development (in this context). Barder illustrates this point by signalling Norman Borlaug, the man who brought about the Green Revolution,
and emphasizing his almost subversion of the accepted path of evolution and intentional cross breading of high yield disease resistant wheat.

### Who was Steve Jones? What did he do at uni-lever? Was he successful? How significant were his results? Page 30
Steve Jones, now a famous evolutionary biologist, was a former employee at a soap powder factory. The soap powder making process utilized
a nozzle (you mix a bunch of chemicals squeeze them through a nozzle which forces them to crystalize, then you pick up what comes out the 
other end and that's your product) which Jones improved. Scientists at uni-lever were trying to optimize the nozzle but had a hard time doing
so as fluid dynamics is non-linear and consequently very hard to model but what Jones did was take the nozzle distort it ten different ways
take the best variation of those nozzles and repeat the process for 45 generations until he came up with a result that made the process 
hundreds of times more efficient, a huge success.
