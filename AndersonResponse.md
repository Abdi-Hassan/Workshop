# Do you believe theory is dead? Do you think we have entered a paradigm shifting revolution of how we describe, analyze, and understand the world?

I do actually believe that while theory is not "dead" it has now been rendered obsolete by the more efficient manner of what I call
connecting the dots, data mining. There are correlations and patterns humand would not and oftentimes could not notice in data that
is very telling of some relationships we may not yet have discovered or could soon hope to discover through the traditional scientific method.
Having big data step in here and allowing computer algorithms to bridge this gap is, in my estimation, the most logical step forward. Now,
I do have to add the caveat that it is imperative for experts and those with relevant jurisdiction over any such field be consulted in order
to best interpret what that data could mean as far as allowing it to contribute to our understanding of the world/reality. However, I would
not go so far as to say that without the consultation of these experts the conclusions made made by data scientists and/or those in the business
fields are automatically wrong or inappropriate. So, I personally do agree we have entered a new paradigm but that doesn't necessarily mean
the technology cannot stand on the shoulders of giants and be integrated and not purely disruptive and ultimately destructive.
