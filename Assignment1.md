# Future Insecurity in Somalia
# Problem Statement
  I am a Somali American immigrant myself and have always been interested in the geopolitical landscape of Somalia and how that has played
a role in the ability of the country to make consistent long term growth and progress on the technological, economic, and social frontiers.
With that being said, I have identified the inability to make predicitions about the long term as the reason for the slow to nonexistent
development of the nation and am thus analyzing contributing factors to what I call "future insecurity". Among these are lack of institutions,
persistent poverty, lack of education, gender inequality, and environmental factors most of which are addressed in one or more of the sources
below. Without a secure future to bank on, the citizens of Somalia-the ultimate agents of change in the nation-will not be able to move forward.

## 1. Africa, P. (2019, December 10). Somalia. Retrieved February 13, 2020, from USAID website: https://www.usaid.gov/powerafrica/wherewework/somalia

This article from the USAid website, more specifically, their "Power Africa" part of the site under the Power Africa initiative, describes a vastly overlooked aspect of the issues plaguing Somalia and hindering the country's development opportunities: energy. The article gives some relevant statistics about the current energy situation in Somalia such as: Only 3.5% of the rural population has access to power, 16% of the population in total have energy access, there are roughly 2.4 million homes without access to power and more. The site also references some background of the energy situation such as the fact that energy hasn't been a public matter since the fall of the government in 1991 but rather a responsibility of the fledgling Somali private sector. This comes with its own set of inefficiencies as a commodity such as energy is often times better handled in a public, government monopoly, type structure just based on the economic nature of providing energy to mass amounts of people and the infrastructure that requires. Beyond this, the article provides a "Somalia Fact Sheet" of sorts that gets into the inner workings of the energy situation within the East African Nation. There is documentation of generation capacity and potential "issues and bottle necks" relating to the nation that could prove rather helpful should my research or problem statement be refined with a heavy emphasis on the energy sector and that aspect of sustainability. For now, however, those details could instead impede my understanding of broader development goals and get me caught up tracking the micro rather than the macro. Another interesting aspect of the fact sheet is the section regarding donor engagement. There is a reference to a "20 year least cost plan" as well as "gap analysis". With more research into the World Bank's funding of this whole Power Africa campaign, the meaning of this could be distilled and potentially guide me to more sources. Additionally, the gap analysis is reminiscent of the gap financing mentioned in the Barder reading but that is to be researched in more detail first. Now this article illustrates Amartya Sen's definition of human development as it addresses both the expansion of economic success but also the advancement of the substantive freedoms the Somali people could enjoy should this area of their lives be improved. It is no secret an improvement in this realm of the Somali peoples' existence would bring about drastic change elsewhere in their abilities to be agents in their own happiness. Furthermore, this achieves many of the sustainable development goals outlined by the United Nations as it expands access to affordable modern energy to more people which subsequently reinforces economic growth in the upkeep of these energy sources, freedom from quotidian tasks made easier through these advents, and even a reduction of regional as well as gender inequalities.

## 2. Geospatial Covariate Data Layers. (2020). Retrieved February 22, 2020, from World Pop website: https://www.worldpop.org/

This annotation is for a few of the mapping options provided on the World Pop website. I was hesitant to even attempt seeking out data regarding Somalia's population as after we had our last discussion regarding population mapping and censuses how some more developed countries have rather accurate up to date population documentation and other LMICs may not. However, with the advent of technology that allows us to circumvent these shortcomings by making the mapping process cheaper, I decided there could be some-perhaps satellite produced-data that may be telling. In referencing back to the World Pop site there, in fact, were quite a few mapping options for which data on Somalia was posted. There was a population map, a map regarding births, and geospatial covariate data layers regarding distance to the coastline for the nation (distance not very great for most of the country unsurprisingly as Somalia has a 3,000+ kilometer coastline!). What really did confuse me though is that I distinctly remember in our reading and discussion that Somalia had not conducted an in-person census in the current century. This is cause for concern beyond the general need for accurate population data for the bevy of reasons we listed in class as it means the data I am looking at seems to be relying on technology and other workarounds that are not proven and are best used when verified against traditional census measures. Furthermore, the lack of change across the years in aggregate population distribution (same regions maintaining the same densities) is also off-putting. While I understand transportation and domestic migration can be limited, I looked for Somalia under the dynamic maps that World Pop offers and they are not one of the individual countries for which that data is offered and thus I am at a loss in that department. Lastly, the maps are oddly non-committal when it comes to quantifying the actual numbers of populations but rather state low, middle, or high populations, etc. A deeper look into the way these data were compiled could unearth more information here but that is beyond the cursory glance given here.

## 3. Health and Education. (2019). In W. B. Group (Comp.), Somali Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment (pp. 90-92) [PDF e-book]. Retrieved from http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/464241565765065128/pdf/Findings-from-Wave-2-of-the-Somali-High-Frequency-Survey.pdf

This citation is for a chapter from an e-book provided by the World Bank Group as a part two of a "high-frequency survey" they've conducted in Somalia. The book takes a holistic approach to the nation's problems documented everything from terrorist funding activities to quality of dwellings and does so with attention to detail. Every chapter is organized and structured so that there are commonplace abbreviations used to cut down on length and accompanying graphs and illustrations to aid the digestion of presented information. While a close reading of the entire document would likely prove invaluable for my understanding of the poverty problem (one of the sustainable development goals I am looking at for Somalia) I decided to hone in one aspect and thus one chapter of this: Education and Health. In this section of the book the authors lay out not only access to healthcare (by comparing home-births to those at medical institutions or with the presence of an aid) and educational opportunities, but do so while stratifying the data across different categories of peoples: rural, urban, refugees in Ethiopia, and even IDP or internally displaced persons. Without getting too far into the details here, the general takeaway is that IDPs have greater access to health care than rural residents but less so than urban residents. As far as education, as measured by adult literacy, the order from most to least literate goes Urban residents, IDP, refugees in Ethiopia, and rural residents. The section goes into further detail about the gender inequality in education as well. This source is honestly likely my most formidable in assembling this annotated bibliography. While illustrating the interconnectedness of all the sustainable development goals, the source also provides commentary on the inequalities that manifest themselves across gender as Sen alluded to in his podcast all the while simultaneously providing the specific context of the country of Somalia. There is also an integration of many of the data science methods we've been exploring in class as well as the use of geospatial data sets all cited throughout the book which can also serve as jumping-off points for further research if need be. Most of all though, the entire premise of the book is to strike at the heart of poverty by answering the why, how, when, where, what questions in regards to Somalia. This is probably my strongest weapon moving forward.

## 4. Policy Recommendations. (2019). In W. B. Group (Comp.), Somali Poverty and Vulnerability Assessment (pp. 58-61) [PDF e-book]. Retrieved from http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/464241565765065128/pdf/Findings-from-Wave-2-of-the-Somali-High-Frequency-Survey.pdf

This entry is another chapter of the same World Bank Group book regarding poverty and vulnerability in Somalia. The cited section here is actually about policy recommendations for the country (based on what was discussed in the first chapter). The chapter actually took the time to point out one thing that is quite easy to overlook through the rest of the opening chapter with the introduction of IDP and that was the urban poor. IDP tend to migrate to cities and, particularly in this case, settle outside the capital city of Mogadishu. With a lack of security of land tenure, these IDP often face forceful evictions and other circumstances less than favorable to their ability to maintain continuity of residency in these urban areas. The outcome of this being widespread urban sprawls and the like in the periphery of the nation's capital, the chapter takes that opportunity to address the potential for city planning and how that could aid and progress much faster the rate of development. There is a call for more long term and planned urban growth projects in the country and a condemnation of the type of "ad hoc" single sector interventions the country has seen in years past. This would hopefully boost the advantage urban populations have over rural residents in the country already in providing higher standards of living and access to services in their communities. There is also a deeper dive in the rest of this section into land-use planning and justifications for the policy recommendations given but the general idea here is to wrap up the opening chapter to the book dispelling any ambiguity and making sense of the data and information amassed thus far. With that being said, there is an effortless refocusing of the book on the end goal, development. While not explicitly stated, I believe this falls right in line with what we had heard from the Amartya Sen podcast regarding development as an expansion of the human freedoms and not just the income and economic abilities of the people. This also addresses, albeit in a rather roundabout way, the sustainable development goal of access to services and infrastructure and builds through the rest of the book a strong case for why that is intertwined with other sustainable development goals.

## 5. Somalia [Fact sheet]. (2018). Retrieved February 21, 2020, from World Health Organization website: https://www.who.int/malaria/publications/country-profiles/profile_som_en.pdf?ua=1

This is another fact sheet borrowed from our coming weeks reading "a special database of health facilities managed by the public health sector in sub-Saharan Africa". The reading shared a link to the World Health Organization's website where actual specific data is posted about all the African countries in the study and I located the fact file relating to my target country of Somalia. This fact file was a bit dense just as the other fact file was but once I was able to take the time to figure what some of it means (still cannot make a claim to knowing what all of it means) I was able to extract some nuggets of information that are very striking to me. For one, there are some areas in the graphs indicating that there are upwards of a few hundred cases of malaria-per 1000 population-and that type of density is quite unsettling. What's interesting to me about this though is that there isn't necessarily the strongest linkage between high PF parasite prevalence and case density as you'd expect but that perhaps just indicates poor epidemiology resources in certain rural areas which can easily be fact-checked against other sources should I continue this line of research. Lastly, regarding these graphs, there are some areas where information is just plain insufficient. This grabs my attention as these areas tend to be to the south more inland Somalia but also rather close to the capital city of Mogadishu. You'd think that those areas immediately surrounding the capital of any country would be well documented but this likely speaks to the political instability of the region if not also the difficulty of documenting anything nationwide in the country. There was also a portion of the fact sheet indicating that private sector mandatory reporting has not been implemented as a part of the surveillance portion of the document and that worries me when contemplating the accuracy of the data as a whole. The data I know I am being presented with is of public health facilities' reports on their own caseloads and that is more verifiable in nature, though.
